# Why backtracking?

### Imagine taking a step in a maze, sometimes the seeming reasonable path may not be the right path, and the right path is not always the easiest one. You may struggle with going forward or back to the origin where the path starts divergent and have to choose another path.

### Backtracking solves the problem when:
* Traversing all the paths with knowing loops are not obvious
* Recording all the paths
