And for the above case when the remaining is 3 then it shouldn't go with selecting 2 again. Obviously, the value selected should be 3, which is [2,2,3].  This isn't a straightforward mindflow for scripting, but we can keep track all the steps by recursion and if one step reaches the goal, then just terminate the path.\n",
